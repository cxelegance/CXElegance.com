CXElegance.com
==============

ongoing development of the CXElegance website (http://www.cxelegance.com)
* see the JS directory for changelog, while TODO is in main JS file

# Why up here on GitHub?

The CXElegance site is for:
* showcasing work projects,
* procuring new work clients/projects, and
* demonstrating a bit how I develop (as a developer)

So feel free to browse and contact me with any suggestions or comments ;)
