				<div class="detail font_size_18">
					<h5>Mark Bennett, salvationarmy.org.nz</h5>
					<p>
						[CXElegance] is excellent at listening to requirements and turning them into functional models that meet your objectives.
						He takes the time to understand what you want to achieve before looking at the processes that are needed.
						Jesse thinks creatively and is not bound by conventional methods or approaches meaning you get brilliantly functional and beautiful results.

				<h2 class="colorWhite">&quot;[a] professional who makes his clients a top priority.&quot;</h2>
				<div class="detail font_size_18">
					<h5>Marzio Manderioli, cartoonsbymarzio.com</h5>
					<p>
						It is my pleasure to recommend [CXElegance] to your firm or business.
						When I hired Jesse to build a web site for my cartooning business I was concerned that the geographical distance between us might lead to delays and frustrations.
						I need not have feared as Jesse's work was nothing short of outstanding.
						Jesse has both a theoretical and practical knowledge of computers and programming.
						He is also a skilled communicator and creative troubleshooter.
						If you hire Jesse you will see that he is an enthusiastic professional who makes his clients a top priority.
						I recommend him to you without reservation.
					</p>

				<h2 class="colorWhite">&quot;I look forward to working with him again...&quot;</h2>
				<div class="detail font_size_18">
					<h5>Aaron Burgess, aaronburgess.com</h5>
					<p>
						[CXElegance] was professional, proactive and easy to work with during the development and construction of my photography blog, [URL no longer active].
						His flexibility during the design phase and dedication made the whole process an enjoyable experience.
						I would have no hesitation in recommending Jesse for Web based work and I look forward to working with him again on future Web projects.

						Cheers

				<h2 class="colorWhite">&quot;...makes searching for old data much faster...&quot;</h2>
				<div class="detail font_size_18">
					<h5>Ana Sanz</h5>
					<p>
						For many years I had been making several redundant backup copies; I had duplicated data unnecessarily in my backups and I needed a method to organize things better.
						[CXElegance] showed me a system that allows me to better organize myself and my data, gradually at my own pace.
						Next time I backup, it will be smaller and faster; I won't have duplicated data in my backups because of his archiving strategy.
						Jesse's method makes searching for old data much faster, and I have saved many gigabytes on my hard disks.
						<br><br>
						Great! Cheers Jesse!
